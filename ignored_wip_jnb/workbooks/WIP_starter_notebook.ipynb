In order to make this a bit less frustrating and help you understand what you need to do (and when you need to do it), we'll quickly review the dataset formats that you'll encounter in this project.

However, there are problems with this format when it comes to actually learning from the data, because the data only makes sense if you know the name of the column that the data can be found it. Since column names are metadata, our algorithms will miss out on what dates each value is for. This means that before we pass this data to our ARIMA model, we'll need to reshape our dataset to **_Long Format_**. Reshaped into long format, the dataframe above would now look like:\n",
